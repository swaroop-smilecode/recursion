### It's continuation of the above chapter named Understand recursion_1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's consider below code.
```
def c():
  print("I am function c")

def b():
  print("I am function b")
  c()

def a():
  print("I am function a")
  b()

a()
```

When you call a function from inside an function, they wont get excuted instantly, instead these function
calls are stored in stack & then the execution starts in Last in First out manner.

This can be better understood by below example.
```
def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return

    print("Entering "+ str(n))
    count_down(n-1)
    print("Returning from "+ str(n))

count_down(3)
```
```
When you execute it, the output is:
Entering 3
Entering 2
Entering 1
Returning from 1
Returning from 2
Returning from 3
```
Why it is getting printed the way it is?
