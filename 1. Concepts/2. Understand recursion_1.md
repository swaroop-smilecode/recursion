### What is Recursion?
- Recursion means a function re occuring --> These re occuring functions are stored inside stack & 
  then called from last in frist out fashion.

- Why the fn need to re occur?
  The duty of new function re occuring is to solve smaller problem compared to the problem solved by
  previous function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3 Steps of any recursive function.
Any recursive fn consists of 3 steps.
1. Recursive means, the fn calling her self again & again. But, we need to stop this recursive nature, right?
   That's the Base case code.

2. First thing of the recursive fn is Base case & Last thing of the recursive fn is calling the fn once again 
   with small problem than the original problem. 
   In between, you can do some work if at all needed. Else no need of this second step at all.

3. Recursive means, the fn calling her self again & again. So, the last thing of the recursive function is 
   calling the function once again with smaller input than the one passed to previous function.

   Thumb rule: Recursive case should progress towards the Base case.

### Example

```
def count_down(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return

    # Specific work you want to do
    print(n)

    # Recursive case
    count_down(n-1)

count_down(10)
```
