Recursion means a function re occuring itslef inside the stack.
The name it self telling you --> Re occur --> Reccur

Why the fn need to re occur?


But, if the fn keeps reoccuring, it needs to stop at one point of time, right?
What's that point? That's the Base case.
```
def count_down(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return

    # Specific work you want to do
    print(n)

    # Recursive case
    count_down(n-1)

count_down(10)
```
