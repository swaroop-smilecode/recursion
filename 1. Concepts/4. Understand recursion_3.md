### Problem:
Write a function sum_numbers_recursive, that takes in a list of numbers and returns 
the sum of all numbers in that list. 

### Solution:
Any recursive solution consists of 2 steps<br/>
<ins>Step 1 (Finding the base case):</ins>
* Base case is nothng but smallest sub problem & In order to find the smallest sub problem, 
  you have to think like below. 
* Here, the problem is sum of numbers present in [5, 2, 9, 10]
* In recursion, sub problem doesn't mean different logic needs to be used in order to solve it.
  The logic remains the same even in sub problem. It's only that the input will be shrinked.
* So, let's make the input smaller by removing the first element of list & then the problem 
  becomes: find the sum of numbers present in <br/>[2, 9, 10]
* Let's continue the process of making input smaller, smaller & eventually you will end up 
  at smallest list that can't be made any more smaller. This is Base case.

<ins>Step 2 (Writing the Recursive step):</ins><br/>
This is not an isolated step, instead it is connected to Base case.
