### Problem:
Write a function sum_numbers_recursive, that takes in a list of numbers and returns 
the sum of all numbers in that list. 

### Solution:
Any recursive solution consists of 2 steps
<u>Step 1 : Finding the base case</u>
* Base case is nothng but smallest sub problem & In order to find the smallest sub problem, 
  you have to think like below. 
* Here, the problem is sum of numbers present in [5, 2, 9, 10]
* Let's make the input smaller by removing the first element of list & then the problem 
  becomes find the sum of numbers present in [2, 9, 10]
* Let's continue the process of making input smaller & smaller & eventually you will end up 
  at smallest list that can't be made smaller any more. This is Base case.

Isn't the sum of numbers present in
[5, 2, 9, 10] is equal to First number of the list + [2, 9, 10]?
That's it. You found the sub problem --> Keep splitting this sub problem again & again
until you reach smallest sub problem that can't be split any more. 
That sub problem which can not be split fruther is called Base case.
