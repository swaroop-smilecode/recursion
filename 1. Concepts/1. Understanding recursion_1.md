### What is Recursion?
- Recursion means a function re occuring --> These re occuring functions are stored inside stack & 
  then called from last in frist out fashion.

- Why the fn need to re occur?
  The duty of new function re occuring is to solve smaller problem compared to the problem solved by
  previous function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4 Steps of any recursive function.
Any recursive function consists of 4 steps & depending upon the problem, 2nd step & 4th step may/may not required,
but, 1st step & 2nd step are always necessary.

1. Recursive means, the fn calling her self again & again. But, we need to stop this recursive nature, right?
   That's the Base case code.

2. Work need to be done before entering into recursive call.

3. Recursive means, the fn calling her self again & again. So, the last thing of the recursive function is 
   calling the function once again with smaller input than the one passed to previous function.
   Thumb rule: Recursive case should progress towards the Base case.

4. Work that needs to be done after coming out of the recursive call.

### Example
```
def count_down(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return

    # Work need to be done before entering into recursive call.
    print(f"Entering {n}")

    # Recursive case
    count_down(n-1)

    # Work need to be done before entering into recursive call.
    print(f"Leaving {n}")
    
count_down(3)
```
